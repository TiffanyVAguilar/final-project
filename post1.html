        <h2>Pantry and Laundry Room</h2>
        <p>
          My first ever major project to organize my home was the pantry/laundry
          room. It took me roughly a month to a month and a half. It wasn’t easy
          for me because something always goes wrong. From painting the room to
          ordering too much of a product. All my ideas and inspirations were
          from Pinterest, The Container Store, and just me. <br /><br />
          My first thing on the list was to paint the room. I just wanted a
          neutral/nude color. I wanted the color to match my farmhouse
          decorations from the kitchen. For the shelves, I wanted to put like a
          wallpaper design on to give it an appealing look, but it wasn’t
          sticking so in the end just painted the shelves. The shelves are
          painted a little darker from the original color of the walls. Honestly
          it looks much better that way. <br /><br />Now into details with what
          type of storage bins/baskets for the pantry. I’m a person that doesn’t
          like to spend too much money. Through my inspirations, it showed me
          that you would have to spend a pretty penny if you wanted to match
          exactly what they had. It’s better to get ideas and make it your own.
          You don’t have to spend a fortune to have an organized pantry.
          <br /><br />I decided to use bins which I bought from Big Lots. In my
          picture above you can see grey and white bins. I used those bins for
          stuff that were in boxes, snacks, and oil bottles. Each bin is labeled
          so everyone can know what’s inside of them. The baskets are from two
          places which is Big Lots and The Container Store. I used those baskets
          for items that were in bags and packages. The cans and jars were put
          on wire stands so it can act like two shelves rather than just one
          shelf. Its nice to see what you have and what is missing. Drinks were
          a bit of a challenge because there were so many ideas you can do with
          them, and we had a lot of drinks. I personally used my last shelf and
          some of my second to last shelf with a wire stand for drinks. Also
          make sure the labels of the bottles are showing. <br /><br />The last
          thing to know is the laundry side. I used two baskets for extra
          detergent and some linens. I got them from Big Lots too. The laundry
          side was way easier because there weren’t so many items on the shelf.
          <br /><br />In the end, you can do whatever is best for your
          pantry/laundry room. I’m just here to give you ideas of what you can
          do and know how to use it.
