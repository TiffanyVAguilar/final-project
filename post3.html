        <h2>Under the sink</h2>
        <p>
          My next project was to organize under the sink. Everything was thrown
          in there and didn’t know what was there. I wanted to make sure when I
          organized under the sink there was a system and see what type of
          products I have. My ideas came from The Container Store because they
          have a page called Projects & Inspirations, and shopping the
          department gave me some pointers of what type of organizers/storage
          bins to buy. <br /><br />Now the first thing I did was to clear out
          the whole cabinet. I threw out products that were old or already
          empty. Then, I bought the Expandable Under Sink Organizer because it
          adjusts around the pipes and the garbage disposal. It was very
          convenient and fit perfectly under my sink, but of course there are so
          many other different organizers to buy. <br /><br />I used the two
          pull-out bins for smaller items like the sponges, rubber gloves, bar
          of soaps, and anything that was small in general. For the shelves I
          used if for items like hand sanitizers, sanitized wipes, liquid soaps,
          rubbing alcohol, and disinfecting sprays. It looked like a vending a
          machine where you can see what you have or missing. <br /><br />For
          the extra space of the cabinet, I used bins as dividers for the
          cleaning products. The wider bin was used for floor’s cleaning
          products. The other two thinner bins were used for extra products and
          any other cleaning products that are not used as much.
          <br /><br />This project didn’t take too much time because it was a
          smaller space. I did like the organizer and bins used for under the
          sink. It was pretty simple to make it look appealing to the eye. In
          the end, if you decide to organize under the sink don’t think you have
          to spend too much money for having it organized. Always look for
          something more economical or make it your own style.
