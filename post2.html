        <h2>Refridgerator</h2>
        <p>
          Who doesn’t love to have an organized fridge? I do, my fridge is
          important as my pantry because you know what you have and know what to
          buy. Inside of my fridge was a mess because usually we just put the
          groceries right away and don’t look back. This is when I realized that
          I needed to do something about it. My fridge is a good size but
          sometimes we think we want a bigger one. <br /><br />I had
          inspirations from the Container Store and images from social media. I
          wanted my fridge to look like when you go on MTV cribs. The only thing
          was that I didn’t want to spend too much money and made sure that I
          can re-use the bins for other items in the fridge too.
          <br /><br />First thing to do is throw away everything that was in my
          refrigerator that was old/expired. We try to only buy groceries that
          we know were going to use rather than buying stuff we never use/cook.
          Also decided that I need to clean the inside of the refrigerator
          because there were stains of food on the shelves and wanted to start a
          clean slate. <br /><br />Next, I decided to do the freezer first
          because everything was already in bags/containers and looks easy to do
          first. The bins I used were the same ones that were from “Under the
          Sink” post which you can get the link from there too. I know that the
          bins are not specifically for the fridge but still worked out.
          <br /><br />Then it was the fridge was a little more time consuming
          because that’s where you have the most items in. I bought the
          bins/organizers from Target. I got a set of 4 bins for sale which was
          a steal. The other bins/organizers were a great price too. I didn’t
          really have a system of how I was going to organize it but knew that
          it had to be appealing to the eye and know where things are at.
          <br /><br />I used the bins for items that were multiples of the same
          food and category. The door of the fridge holds single drinks,
          condiments, and anything that is miscellaneous and small that I can
          fit there. <br /><br />Now everyone has different things in their
          freezer or fridge so for me what I did is to categorized items that
          are similar and look appealing to the eye. In the end, it is up to you
          of how you want to organize your refrigerator. Just make sure that you
          have a plan or an idea of what you want to do and do it. Make it how
          you want to see your items and what is accessible for you. Remember
          you don’t have to spend a pretty penny to have an organized
          refrigerator.
